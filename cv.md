# About me



I am 30 years old, single. I am a pipeline transport engineer by education, but I work in a construction company, certain life circumstances forced me to change my field of activity.

I want to try something new, since I decided to change my occupation, why not front-end development? I think my mind, obstinacy and desire to develop will be enough for me to achieve something in this direction.
